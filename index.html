      Welcome, this site has one purpose and one purpose only, to show a box
      that you can bounce around with!
    </p>
    <h3>Wh... Why would you create such a silly thing?</h3>
    <p>Ehm, well first of all, that is a good question and I'm afraid I don't have a good answer...</p>
    <p>
      We could summarise it with boredom, I had an afternoon free and someone had sent me some obscure
      canvas library used in a Swedish code sandbox by some school and whatnot. It included a demo that
      drew a square on the screen. I then spent half an hour or so implementing some
      basic gravity and friction. Then I decided to siwtch to some maintained library and well
      <a href="https://p5js.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">p5.js</a> had a suprisingly similar API.
    </p>
    <h3>Do you have some made up ratings for this?</h3>
    <p>Yup</p>
    <span class="rating five" aria-label="5/5 stars">Oddly Satisfying - Josefine</span>
    <span class="rating five" aria-label="5/5 stars">I'm hooked - Arvid</span>
    <span class="rating five" aria-label="5/5 stars">Who knew a bouncy boi could be so addicting - David</span>
    <span class="rating one" aria-label="5/5 stars">This game has ruined my family, and my
      relationships with all my friends. I must fill the screen - Truls</span>
    <h3>Do you want to mention anything else?</h3>
    <p>
      Oh right, you can find the code on GitHub:
      <a href="https://github.com/svbeon/bouncyboi">svbeon/bouncyboi</a>.
      It's licenced under a MIT licence, like basically everything i create is.
      I have some ideas on how to improve this project, you can find them under issues,
      unfortunately I haven't really fleshed them out with detailed descriptions,
      but PR's are welcome if you want to add something or have the time and energy to
      implement anything on the wish-list. I do need to warn you, the code is not created to be
      efficient, but it has some basic documentation. If you feel that you can improve the code,
      please do, it hurts me to look at it. At the same time, most code I've published at the
      moment is a pain for me to watch beacuse I've been short on time and haven't been able to
      live up to the code standard I would prefer.
    </p>
